Associate rule is one of the unsupervised ML algorithm, we mainly use this for cross-selling the things or for up-sellings the things.
For example using this rule we can suggest the customer to buy both the items like, if a customer orders biryani, he may also order coke.
For example {Bread,Egg} {Milk}
                  |        |
            (Antecedent) (consequent)
We have three kinds of equation used in this rule they are 1)support 2)confidence 3)Lift
1)Support: It is calculated in this way support({X}-{y} = Transactions containing both X and y / Total number of transactions (assume X as biryani and y as coke.)
2)Confidence : Occurance of consequent on the cart given that cart already has the antecedents 
   Confidence({X} {y}) = Transactions containing both X and y / Transactions containing X
3)Lift: Lift controls for the support (frequency) of consequent while calculating the conditional probabilty of occurance of {y} given {X}
   Lift({X} {y}) = (Transaction of both (X and y) /(Transaction of X)
                    /Fraction of transaction containing y
                    
To support this rule I have used my dummy dataset to demostrate the things.
